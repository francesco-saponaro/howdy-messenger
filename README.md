# HOWDY Messenger app
## Overview
The purpose of this application was both to further practice my React skills and create a catchy Frontend.  

For the above reasons I have used Firebase to implement the Backend which greatly reduced my workload, thanks to its extensive tools and rapid development and deployment process.   

Along with a clean interface, transitions and animations, the application includes authentication and social media features like emoticons, like/unlike messages, sending pictures and a list of online users.    

To manage the state, for such a small application, I have used Context API, since compared to Redux requires minimal setup and is a more light-weight solution for passing little data throughout the app.   

If you would like to test this app here is the [deployed version](https://messenger-app-faaff.web.app/)
